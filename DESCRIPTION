Title: ssPATHS: Single Sample  PATHway Score
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Natalie R. Davidson
Maintainer: Natalie R. Davidson <natalie.davidson@inf.ethz.ch>
Description: This package generates pathway scores from expression data for 
    single samples after training on a reference cohort. The score is generated 
    by taking the expression of a set of genes (pathway) from a reference cohort
    and performing linear discriminant analysis to distinguish samples in the 
    cohort that have the pathway augmented and not. The separating hyperplane is
    then used to score new samples.
